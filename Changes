    New features:

    - you can now subscribe via websockets
    - cards can be moved

    Known bugs:

    - paging is fundamentally broken in the current version of the Trello
    API: you get offset+limit, but ordering is fixed, so as soon as
    a card is moved from the original board or list the concept breaks.
